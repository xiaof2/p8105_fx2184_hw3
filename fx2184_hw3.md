Mean Hour of the Day

# problem 2

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent? Accelerometer data allows
the inspection activity over the course of the day. Make a single-panel
plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each day and use
color to indicate day of the week. Describe in words any patterns or
conclusions you can make based on this graph.

``` r
# tidy the dataset 
accel<- read_csv("accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440, 
    names_to = "minute",
    values_to = "activity",
    names_prefix = "activity_", 
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    day_of_week = recode(day,
                         "Monday" = "Weekday", 
                         "Tuesday" = "Weekday", 
                         "Wednesday" = "Weekday", 
                         "Thursday" = "Weekday", 
                         "Friday" = "Weekday", 
                         "Saturday" = "Weekend", 
                         "Sunday" = "Weekend"))

-   The dataset `accel` contains 50400 observations, and 6 varibles,
    which are week, day_id, day, minute, activity, day_of_week.
-   Each observation represent a male subject’s activity count per
    minute of each day during five weeks.

\#aggregate across minutes

``` r
#aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?
accel %>% 
  group_by(week,day) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity=sum(activity)) %>% 
  spread(key= day, total_activity) %>% 
  select("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday") %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 0,
    catpion = "Aggregation of a Total Activity across Minutes for Each Day")

-   From the table, it hard to tell there is a trend exists. However, in
    the first 3 weeks, it seems like the subject has higher total
    activity during the weekend than weekdays.

-   Between 0hr (12am) to 6hr (6am), it is to be observed that the
    activity count of a 63 year-old male is the lowest across days.
    Around 7hr (7am), his activity count is relatively high on some
    Thursdays. Around 9hr (9am), his activity count is quite high on
    some Fridays. Around 12hr (12pm), his activity count is high on many
    Sundays. Between 16hr (4pm) and 17hr (5pm), his activity count is
    relatively high on a decent number of weekends. Between 20hr (8pm)
    and 22hr(10pm), his activity count is high across many days,
    especially on Friday followed by Saturday, Wednesday, Monday.
